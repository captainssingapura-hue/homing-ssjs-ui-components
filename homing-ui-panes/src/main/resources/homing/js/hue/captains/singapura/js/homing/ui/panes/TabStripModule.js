// =============================================================================
// TabStrip — the row of chips over a pane: chips with a label and a cross,
// the tail with the add button and the count, the drop mark, and the drag
// that reorders. It holds no tab state: the pane tells it which chips, in
// which order, and which is active; it tells the pane what was clicked and
// where a dragged chip landed. A branch component: the pane makes a
// sub-branch for it and hands it in.
//
//   new TabStrip(branch, { onAdd?, onDrop(chip, dest), onGroundMenu?, onClose? })
//     onClose() — the bar's own cross, at its end, for a strip that is a window's
//     one bar: a float's. Without it there is no cross.
//     onGroundMenu(at) → boolean: a right-click on the strip's own ground —
//     the room the chips leave, and the tail — asks whoever holds the pane
//     for a menu there; true means it was taken and the browser's own menu is
//     suppressed. A right-click on a chip is the chip's, never the ground's.
//     strip.el
//     strip.chip({ id, title, icon?, pinned, closable }, { onSelect, onClose, onMenu? }, branch?) → chipEl
//         icon: an element of the holder's — a favicon — shown before the label
//         onMenu(at, keyboard) → boolean: a right-click on the chip, or the
//         ContextMenu key / Shift+F10 on it, asks for the tab's menu at a point;
//         true means it was taken and the browser's own menu is suppressed
//                                   minted by TabChip on the branch given — the tab's own,
//                                   dissolved when the tab leaves — else the strip's; the
//                                   strip gives it its size and aspect and arms it for the rail
//     strip.adopt(chip, pinned)     a chip minted elsewhere taken in — a tab-pane's, which
//                                   travels: this strip's size and aspect, armed for the rail
//                                   unless pinned. strip.chip is TabChip.mint and then this
//     strip.retitle(chip, title)    the chip's label, its tooltip and its cross's name, now
//     strip.reicon(chip, icon?)     the chip's icon now: an element, or none
//     strip.arrange(chips)          the chips in order, before the tail
//     strip.remove(chip)            out of the row, disarmed, and left as a chip at rest:
//                                   unselected, down, unmarked, for whatever strip is next
//     strip.select(chips, active)   aria-selected on the active one, and that one
//         brought into view: a bar wider than its room scrolls, and a tab you
//         cannot see is a tab you cannot tell you are on
//     strip.window                  TabWindow: the row squeezed to the room, and where over it
//         the bar is looking. The strip tells it the row and which chip to rest on; it owns
//         the rail, the squeeze and the scrolling, and the wheel here asks it to step
//     strip.keys(chip, state)       where the keys are, said on one chip: "held"
//         while the bar has them — the chip lifted, the colour part of the way —
//         "lent" while what the tab holds has them — the chip down again, the
//         colour at full, the within mark on it — or null on none
//     strip.count(n, addOn)         the pill, and the add button on or off
//     strip.ground(target)          whether an event's target is the strip's own ground — the
//         room the chips leave, and the tail — and not a chip or a control on it: where a
//         press may move a window whose bar the strip is
//     strip.at(clientX, clientY)    a point on the strip: the index a tab from
//         outside would land at, marked there; −1 when the point is not on it
//     strip.markAt(clientX)         the mark where a tab from outside would land → index
//     strip.indexAt(clientX)        where a tab from outside would land, unmarked → index
//     strip.takeover(fn?)           fn(chip, pressEvent) → true when a holder takes the press: a
//                                   desk whose hand carries a chip across strips and floats; none, the hand's
//     strip.slide(chip, x, grabX?)  → the hand's slide begun by call: { place(x), end(commit) }
//     strip.unmark()
//     strip.current(on)             the bar lit: this is the dock being worked in
//     strip.size(s?)                the chips' size, −1..1, 0 the design's; every chip, now and later
//     strip.dispose()
//     strip.aspect(a?)              the chips' aspect, −1..1, 0 the design's proportion — wide,
//                                   a browser's tab — narrower at −1, wider at +1
//
// No chip takes native focus, and the strip takes no keys: the keys over a
// strip are its pane's — ← → walk the tabs while the pane holds them — and
// a chip that were a focusable button would take them away after every
// press. The design draws the hover, the press and the selected one, since
// the chip wears Selectable. The press is the selection: a chip is selected
// the moment it is pressed, before any release, and the chip in the hand —
// pressed, dragged, pulled off — is the selected one throughout; nothing
// else selects while it is held. A press on the strip moves no native focus
// by the browser's default, and takes it away from whatever had it.
//
// The drag is a browser's, along a rail: the chip pressed is lifted and goes
// where the hand goes along the row — the press remembered as an offset
// within the chip, so the chip is placed and never the hand — kept within
// the row, and never off it; the slot it is nearest is where it will land,
// and the chips between step aside, live, as it passes them. Let go, it
// settles onto its slot, and the pane is told: onDrop(chip, dest), a move.
// TabHand is the hand, TabDrag the arithmetic. Leaving the row — a tab
// that detaches and floats — is not here yet; the pane's dock takes a tab
// by call. Pinned chips are not dragged.
//
// A tab offered from outside is marked where it would land: a bar inserted
// between chips, at the count of those whose middle is left of the point,
// never before the pinned ones. Nothing is positioned by hand: the chip in
// the hand carries --mtp-drag-x, a chip stepping aside --mtp-shift-x. `css`
// is injected with the styles import.
