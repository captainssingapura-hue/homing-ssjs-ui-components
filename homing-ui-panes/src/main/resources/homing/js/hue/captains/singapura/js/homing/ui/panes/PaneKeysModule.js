// =============================================================================
// A PANE'S KEYS ARE SWAPPABLE, and this module holds the two that ship. A
// scheme is an object with two methods and no state:
//
//   scheme.keyDown(pane, ev) → true when taken   the pane HOLDS the keys
//   scheme.chord(pane, ev)   → true when taken   something below it is natively
//                                                focused and a chord got past
//   scheme.keeps(pane)       → whether the pane is a PLACE THE KEYS CAN REST
//                                                at all, or only ever a road to
//                                                the tab that is showing
//
// Two entry points because there are two ways a key can arrive, and a scheme
// that means to work in both answers both from one table. A pane is given a
// list and tries them in order; the first to take the key has it — and the
// FIRST one also says whether the pane keeps the keys, because that is not a
// per-key question but a question about what the pane IS. A list is therefore
// one scheme's character with another's keys added, not two characters at
// once.
//
// PaneKeys — the pane in the keyboard party, over the pane's own surface and
// nothing about how the pane is built: what a key means for a container of
// tabs (level 1 of the two levels: the container's own operations and no
// more), what the walk is offered, and the law a tab's widget must keep.
//
//   PaneKeys.keyDown(pane, ev) → true when taken
//     ← →              the active tab moves to the previous / next, at once; no wrap
//     Home / End       the first / last tab
//     Shift+← / →      the active tab moves one slot along the rail, staying active
//     Shift+↓          the active tab asked to detach: pane.requestDetach()
//     Enter            the active tab's widget activates itself — a claim of its own
//     Escape           TAKEN AND KEPT: the dock is where Escape stops. Coming
//                      out of a tab's widget lands on the bar, and pressing it
//                      again does nothing - one key cannot walk you out of the
//                      room by accident. Leaving a dock is its own gesture,
//                      the page's switcher, and never a key you were already
//                      pressing. pane.yieldKeys() remains, for a holder that
//                      wants to give them up by call
//     Shift+F10, ContextMenu   the active tab's menu, at its chip: pane.menuByKey()
//
//   PaneKeys.chord(pane, ev) → false, always. This scheme's keys are the
//     container's own and are meant for a hand that is on the bar; reaching
//     into a tab's widget to take an arrow off it is the very thing the
//     native world is promised it may keep.
//
//   BrowserKeys.keyDown / .chord — the other scheme, below: what a browser
//     does, in both places, because that is its whole character.
//   A chord with Ctrl, Alt or Meta is left; so is anything not above.
//
//   PaneKeys.keysState(pane) → where the keys are, for the active chip: "held"
//     on the bar, "lent" while they are within a tab, or null. The frame's own
//     mark is the steward's (RFC 0066 E3, keyboard §17.5)
//   PaneKeys.wouldOffer(pane, m) → whether the walk is offered a member of
//     the dock's branch: only the tab on show, the rest being behind it
//   PaneKeys.law(widget) → whether a tab's widget is logically focusable:
//     a member of a branch, with activate(); level 2 rests on it
//
// Pure: it imports nothing and touches no DOM. A pure module must not import
// a DOM module - its imports resolve without the page's theme and would load
// a second copy of it, and of any one-per-document manager it imports. So
// the yield goes through the pane, which imports Keys as a DOM module does.
