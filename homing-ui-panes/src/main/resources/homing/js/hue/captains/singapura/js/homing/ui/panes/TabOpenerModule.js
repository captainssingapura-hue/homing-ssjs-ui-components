// =============================================================================
// TabOpener — what a new tab holds until you say what it should hold. The
// strip's plus cannot know which of a page's kinds you meant, and guessing one
// is worse than asking: so the plus opens a tab with this in it, and picking
// from it TURNS THAT TAB INTO the thing you picked. The chip you made is the
// chip you keep, in the place you made it.
//
//   new TabOpener(branch, { focus, pane, source, tab?, tabId?, prompt? })
//     focus:  the dock's branch, as any tab's widget joins it
//     pane:   the dock it is in — it replaces itself there, so it must know
//     source: the TabSource; its listed kinds are the choices, which is why
//             the opener's own kind is declared listed:false and never offers
//             itself among them
//     tab:    its own tab-pane's handle, from a source with a register: the tab
//             it turns, in place, into what you pick
//     tabId:  without one, its own tab's id, so it can find its place and give it up
//
//   opener.open(kindId)   → the index the new tab ended at, or −1. What you pick
//                         takes the keys, because you were holding them here
//
// IT REPLACES RATHER THAN CONTAINS. A widget's root is appended to its tab's
// panel once and never detached, so an opener that mounted the chosen thing
// inside itself would be a tab that is always an opener, wearing somebody
// else's name. Giving up the tab and asking the source for a fresh one costs
// three calls and leaves nothing of the opener behind — and the source's rule
// for minting is the same rule the standalone control uses, so a tab opened
// here and a tab added there are the same kind of thing.
//
// The choices are NATIVE buttons inside a logical member: the widget holds the
// keys for the dock, the button that has the browser's focus holds them for
// the widget — said as `lent`, which is what a design answers — and an Escape
// the button did not want comes back to the widget rather than out of the
// room. That is the §14 seam, wired here once so a page need not wire it.
