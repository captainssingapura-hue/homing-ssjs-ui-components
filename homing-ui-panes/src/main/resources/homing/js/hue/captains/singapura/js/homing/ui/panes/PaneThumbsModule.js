// PaneThumbs — a picture of where the panes are, to pick one by. A button per
// pane, laid out in the proportions the panes really have on the screen, in a
// frame of the same shape as the room they fill. You choose a pane by pointing
// at the small one in the same place as the big one.
//
//   new PaneThumbs(branch, { host, panes, onPick?, labelOf?, enabledOf?, width? })
//     panes:     () → [pane], asked afresh on every refresh, because a
//                workspace is split and merged while the control stands there
//     onPick:    (pane) as one is chosen; the picture decides nothing else
//     labelOf:   (pane) → the word in the box; its slotId unless said
//     enabledOf: (pane) → whether it can be chosen at all; everything can
//                unless said. A pane that cannot is SHOWN, not hidden: where it
//                is is part of the picture, and a gap would be a lie about the room
//
//   thumbs.refresh()       measure again and lay out again, by hand
//   thumbs.picked()        the chosen pane, or null
//   thumbs.pick(pane)      choose one in code; null chooses none
//   thumbs.dispose()
//
// IT WATCHES rather than measures once. A page is built detached and appended
// afterwards, so everything is nought pixels wide at the moment a control is
// constructed; a window is resized; a splitter is dragged. All three are the
// same event — a pane changed size — so the panes themselves are what is
// observed, and the picture is redrawn a frame later. Nothing has to remember
// to nudge it.
//
// IT MEASURES RATHER THAN READS A LAYOUT. A grid could describe its own tree
// and this would draw that, but then it would work for a grid and nothing
// else — not a dock that floats, not two workspaces side by side, not a pane
// somebody simply put on the page. Rectangles are what every pane has in
// common, so rectangles are what this knows: the union of them is the room,
// and each one's share of it is where its thumbnail goes. The picture is
// therefore always of what is actually there.
